This is a very early prototype, approximately 10 days of efforts are concentrated here, and I would really like to show you my thoughts.
# Developmental setups:
### Project setup
```
npm install
```
### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

# The Project is currently running on Firebase Hosting

https://ticks-collectives-s.web.app/

Basic functions running now: You may log in using your google account,

You may track your progress by clicking buttons provided on the web. Batteries may be charged up when you made some progress! And items will be collected when you have a fully charged battery, after that, your terminal charges will be reset! Happy collecting those little rewards! All the record will be saved with your google account. Your cookies will keep you logged in! (Item collecting only available when logged in)

Log in with google account to have a try on the simple progress tracking function

# Ticks, Collectives ... & more. The Story

## The main focus:

Generated from real personal experiences. Psychological pressure related problems including panic attacks and being extremely unstable with focusing are the largest issues I’m currently suffering from. And these are also suffering by many others, in many different negative forms.

Sadly some of the bad habits are easily integrated by our brain and its really hard to peel them off. Inspired by *The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business*, a book by *Charles Duhigg*, I was able to learn the idea of substituting habitual actions our brain’s hidden signals made us to do. It introduces a patient having nail biting problem that was harming his daily life very badly, the curing method made him gradually use tick and cross to mark a week table, and help him to find out the trigger of biting his nails.

Project's main focus on solving the challenge: make users gradually integrate the product into their daily routine to help with their problem. Yet this may not be ideal, I hope the toolkit is positively addictive and can help me change some of my bad habit.

Expanding from personal ideas, reaching an actual solution to the addressed challenge Towards building a prototype in first. I’m building a special ‘reminders’ kind of tool. Firstly, what is the specific problem with traditional ones / the ones come with ppl’s smartphones? - You have to come up with your own schedule, and manage to set all things up, and remember to tick it away, no matter if it is daily / long term based. Personally I feel pressure coming from myself seeing things not being completed by my original expectation, and this has been happening way too much.

The key concept and the terminal goal here is how to build a pressureless reminder / recorder. Simplifying things down, and reward users with positive feelings in any situation - even when ones failed to complete their goal in a single day - centralising everything around the basic reminding/scheduling/recording, functions like relaxation/breathing exercise and item/reward collections tradings.

Currently I'd say it's really a shabby frame. And it is 100% user-self-driven and some of those functions are missing. I need to put more guidence and nicer graphics to keep users be constantly having a bell rining in their mind. I see the solution project ideally as a half self-driven tool to help us peel of some of those bad habits like generating pressures and panics and many other harmful habitual problems.

# **Future, looking back on the original thoughts**

Now it's a just a web app, with some shabby function working. I have two major directions on keep going with this project. First, more efforts on mobile development and build up the all the desired functions:
- **Interactions with rewards, nicer designs of badges/reward items**
- **Help with sudden panic attack, record user breathing / help them with some calming down activities, and integrate it with the battery system**
- **Customisable Buttons / more visually integrated and comfortable designed elements**
- **......narratives and more attractions to make things work**

The problem with sticking with mobile devices: THEY ALWAYS PROVIDE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING FOCUS, and sometimes the information people receiving from them can be really annoying/pressure-producing. What may be an alternative way to solve this. A naive but doable idea of building another device. It might comes with an app yet that's not the main focus point and is mainly for keeping the reward system.

So some discrete thoughts on this happens:
	The tiny, colourful and light-weighted mobile device is more a stop sign held in between just being triggered into a bad habitual action to completely losing control.
- **Buttons, now users may tick (record there daily progress on what they desire to be recorded) on this device, some sort of LED/screen indications will be triggered**
- **Motor to help with building a vibration system to support interactions with users, and can help users to do breathing, mindfulness & multiple relaxing exercise by physical indications provided to users**
- **Some interactions: e.g. reward collecting, recording progresses & breathing activity force users to put down other stuffs (holding multiple buttons at the same time) (p.s. alternative physical disability supports will be included). This is a reset on users' focus session and help with cut down up-stacking pressures**
- **Picking it up is a part of distraction and putting it down and go back to what you want to be focused on is also a part of your distraction, this is what I really want to build after all, and all the ticks and rewards are contributing to building a relatively positive habit. I want this to be a crutch for people like me with some of those modern crisis**
