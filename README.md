This is a very early prototype, approximately 10 days of efforts are concentrated here, and I would really like to show you my thoughts.

# Ticks, Collectives ... & more. The Story

## The main focus:

Generated from real personal experiences. Psychological pressure related problems including panic attacks and being extremely unstable with focusing are the largest issues I’m currently suffering from. And these are also suffering by many others, in many different negative forms.

Sadly some of the bad habits are easily integrated by our brain and its really hard to peel them off. Inspired by *The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business*, a book by *Charles Duhigg*, I was able to learn the idea of substituting habitual actions our brain’s hidden signals made us to do. It introduces a patient having nail biting problem that was harming his daily life very badly, the curing method made him gradually use tick and cross to mark a week table, and help him to find out the trigger of biting his nails.

**What an I aiming for?**

I’m meant to be focusing on very specific issue. The original thought was a set of tool can help to manage with the previously mentioned issues. And make users gradually integrate the product into their daily routine to help with their problem. Yet this may not be ideal, I hope the toolkit is positively addictive and can help me change some of my bad habit. 

Expanding from personal ideas, reaching an actual solution to the addressed challenge
Towards building a prototype in first. I’m building a special ‘reminders’ kind of tool. Firstly, what is the specific problem with traditional ones / the ones come with ppl’s smartphones? - You have to come up with your own schedule, and manage to set all things up, and remember to tick it away, no matter if it is daily / long term based. Personally I feel pressure coming from myself seeing things not being completed by my original expectation, and this has been happening way too much.

The key concept here is how to build a pressureless reminder / scheduler. Simplifying things down, and reward users with positive feelings in any situation - even when ones failed to complete their goal in a single day, I would like to put some inspiration which came from video games in it, yet still - centralising everything around the basic reminding/scheduling function.

In extremely, simply, short: Ticks and Collectives

# **Future, looking back on the original thoughts**

Now it's a just a web app, with some shabby function working. I have two major directions on keep going with this project. First, more efforts on mobile development and build up the all the desired functions:
- **Interactions with rewards, nicer designs of badges/reward items**
- **Help with sudden panic attack, record user breathing / help them with some calming down activities, and integrate it with the battery system**
- **Customisable Buttons / more visually integrated and comfortable designed elements**
- **......narratives and more attractions to make things work**

The problem with sticking with mobile devices: THEY ALWAYS PROVIDE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING FOCUS, and sometimes the information people receiving from them can be really annoying/pressure-producing. What may be an alternative way to solve this. A naive but doable idea of building another device. It might comes with an app yet that's not the main focus point and is mainly for keeping the reward system.

So some discrete thoughts on this happens:
	The tiny, colourful and light-weighted mobile device is more a stop sign in between the way from just being distracted a bit to completely losing control.
- **Buttons, now users may tick (record there daily progress on what they desire to be recorded) on this device, some sort of LED/screen indications will be triggered**
- **Motor to help with building a vibration system to support interactions with users, and can help users to do breathing, mindfulness & multiple relaxing exercise by physical indications provided to users**
- **Some interactions: e.g. reward collecting, recording progresses & breathing activity force users to put down other stuffs (holding multiple buttons at the same time) (p.s. alternative physical disability supports will be included). This is a reset on users' focus session and help with cut down up-stacking pressures**
- **Picking it up is a part of distraction and putting it down and go back to what you want to be focused on is also a part of your distraction, this is what I really want to build after all, and all the ticks and rewards are contributing to building a relatively positive habit. I want this to be a crutch for people like me with some of those modern crisis**
